## Web address

Example app is hosted at [vspace.arkadyt.dev](https://vspace.arkadyt.dev).

## Description

This is an open source e-commerce website project. It's built on MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node). It defines many UI components, forms and utilities that can help you bootstrap your own e-commerce application. Take a look around!

You are also more than welcome to fork this project and build something of your own on top of it! Following sections of this readme explain how to launch the application locally, deploy it and run tests.

## Run locally

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:arkadyt/vspace.git && cd vspace
```

Add an .env file to the repo root:

```
PORT=5050
NODE_ENV=development

# intentionally not configuring db auth
MONGO_URI='mongodb://db:27017/wework'
```

Run and view the app:

```
docker-compose up -d
cd ./client && yarn && yarn start
```

## Run tests

```
# to run client-side tests
cd ./client && yarn test

# to run server-side tests
cd ./server && yarn test
```

## Deploying the application

To deploy the frontend bundle to S3 refer to the ./client/deploy.sh deployment script.

Deploying the backend application depends on your preferences. The example deployment which I referenced in Web Address section of this README file is deployed onto an EC2 instance with a bootstrap script. You can find the script here: https://github.com/arkadyt/dotfiles/blob/master/cloud/api-servers/foss-other/aws-ec2-build.sh. This type of deployment is obviously NOT suitable for production, but gives you an idea of what's needed to successfully deploy this application.
